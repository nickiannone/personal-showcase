# Personal Showcase

This application is intended to be a React single-page application which provides users the ability to create and maintain a virtual CV/portfolio for use in job searching, public demonstration of work and casual experience, and personal fundraising through external services such as GoFundMe and ko-fi.

This project is also a functional exploration of the React framework, as well as an attempt to learn Test-Driven Development using React.

Currently, the persistence solution for this website uses a manually-configured local Strapi instance, but a Swagger document is being built which can be used to generate a custom backend solution in whatever language or tool you desire.

If you wish to support this application's development, consider dropping a few bucks at http://ko-fi.com/shotgunninja. Every bit helps!
