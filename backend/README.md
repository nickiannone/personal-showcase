# Personal Showcase Backend

This section is intended to be a flexible backend API service for the Personal Showcase application.

The Personal Showcase application was originally designed to run using a Strapi backend, but it quickly became apparent that this was not sufficient for the granularity of permissions required (ie. limiting editing of a Profile to the user who owns that profile). As such, this space will be reserved for the buildout of a Node.js backend and REST API which will provide quick and easy local setup of the persistence and business logic layer for the Personal Showcase site.

For details on generating an API, please see /swagger.yaml (note - this is a work in progress!)
